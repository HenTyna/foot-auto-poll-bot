# Visual Menu System Implementation

## Overview
The bot has been successfully converted from a poll-based system to a visual menu interface that matches the requested UI design.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Menu Processor (`bot/menu_processor.py`)
- **Replaced poll creation** with visual menu display
- **Added quantity button system** for each menu item (1-3 quantities)
- **Implemented real-time menu updates** with current quantities
- **Added user quantity tracking** per menu item
- **Created menu ID system** using timestamp and chat ID
- **Horizontal button layout** - each menu item gets its own row with quantity buttons
- **Item names in buttons** - buttons show item names so users know which buttons correspond to which items
- **Vote-based counting** - quantities are only counted after users click the Vote button

### 2. Handlers (`bot/handlers.py`)
- **Removed poll answer handler** (no longer needed)
- **Added quantity selection handler** for processing user quantity choices
- **Added vote button handler** with 3-second confirmation animation
- **Updated order button handler** to work with new menu system
- **Fixed callback data parsing** to handle menu IDs with underscores
- **Vote processing** - quantities are only processed and counted when Vote button is clicked

### 3. Utils (`bot/utils.py`)
- **Added `format_visual_menu()` function** to create the visual menu display
- **Updated `format_order_summary()`** to work with quantity-based selections
- **Enhanced user detail display** showing quantities per user
- **Clean menu display** without button layout preview since buttons now have item names

### 4. Config (`bot/config.py`)
- **Removed poll-related configuration**
- **Updated welcome message** to reflect new menu system
- **Updated error messages** to reference "menu" instead of "poll"

### Horizontal Quantity Selection System
- **3 quantity buttons** (1-3) for each menu item
- **Item names in buttons** - buttons show "បបរសាច់គោ 1", "បបរសាច់គោ 2", etc.
- **Horizontal layout** - each menu item gets its own row with 3 quantity buttons
- **Vote-based counting** - quantities are only counted after clicking Vote button
- **Pending selections** - user selections are stored but not counted until voting
- **Real-time updates** showing total quantities from all users who voted

### Vote Button Animation
- **3-second confirmation** showing "✅ Confirm"
- **Vote processing** - quantities are processed and counted when Vote is clicked
- **Menu update** - menu display updates to show new quantities after voting
- **No quantity reset** after voting

### Enhanced Order Summary

## Technical Implementation

### Menu ID System
- Format: `menu_{chat_id}_{timestamp}`
- Ensures unique identification across multiple chats
- Handles callback data parsing with underscores

### Data Storage
- **menu_data**: Stores menu information and message IDs
- **global_orders**: Tracks total quantities per menu item (only from voted users)
- **user_selections**: Stores user names and their quantity selections
- **user_quantities**: Detailed quantity tracking per user per item (voted quantities)
- **pending_selections**: Stores pending selections before voting

### Callback Data Format
- Quantity selection: `qty_{menu_id}_{item_index}_{quantity}`
- Vote: `vote_{menu_id}`
- Order: `order_{menu_id}`
- Close order: `close_order_{menu_id}`

### Button Layout
- **Item names in buttons**: Each button shows item name + quantity (e.g., "បបរសាច់គោ 1")
- **Horizontal arrangement**: Each menu item gets its own row
- **3 quantity buttons**: [1] [2] [3] for each item
- **Vote button**: Single button at the bottom
- **Dynamic layout**: Adapts to any number of menu items

### Voting Logic
- **Pending selections**: User selections are stored in `pending_selections` but not counted
- **Vote processing**: When Vote button is clicked, `process_user_vote()` is called
- **Quantity counting**: Only after voting are quantities moved to `user_quantities` and counted in global orders
- **Menu updates**: Menu display only updates after voting to show new quantities

## Usage Flow
1. User sends menu text with numbered items
2. Bot creates visual menu with horizontal quantity buttons (showing item names)
3. Users click quantity buttons to select amounts (1-3) - quantities are NOT shown yet
4. Users click "Vote" to confirm their selections
5. Quantities are processed and menu updates to show total quantities from all users who voted
6. Admin clicks "Order" to see detailed summary
7. Admin can close order to hide buttons

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- Same menu text format supported
- Order and close order buttons work as before
- Scheduled messages continue to work

## Testing
- All syntax checks passed
- Visual menu formatting tested and working
- Order summary formatting tested and working
- Callback data parsing tested and working
- Horizontal button layout tested and working
- Vote-based counting logic tested and working
